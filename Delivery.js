// You are a delivery person and your task is to deliver packages to different cities. 
// You deliver packages in different trips. You take a flight to a city(c1) and then deliver packages 
// to all the cities connected by road. You then take another flight to deliver packages to the next 
// set of cities and so on until all the packages are delivered.Given a set of roads: 
// [(c1, c2), (c4, c5), (c3, c6).....] and a set of deliveries: [c1, c6, c8, c11â€¦] where c1 means a 
// delivery in c1 and the order of the deliveries don't matter. All the cities may not be connected 
// together so you may have to take multiple flights/trips. Your task to find the minimum number of trips/flights 
// required to complete a given set of deliveries
